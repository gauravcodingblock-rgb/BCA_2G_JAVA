/*for Loop in Java
Concept

A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
It combines initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in a single line.

Syntax
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to execute
}

Examples
Sum of First 10 Natural Numbers*/
public class ForExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            sum += i; // add each number to sum
        }
        System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
    }
}



// output Sum = 55
